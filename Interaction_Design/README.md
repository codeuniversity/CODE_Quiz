Elias Khattar, Max Ropohl

CODE Project "CODE Quiz", WS 17/18

 ## Where is the work?
 - __Design graphics__: this repo
 - __Design graphics, concepts, sketches__: [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B6oYNUzRO6rcLWdOZkFQQmdNaXM?usp=sharing)
 - __Screens__: [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/EwdID8vTK7g2k8Cdkr1HdF6i/Screens)
 - __Click prototype__: [Proto.io](https://pr.to/YATROW/)

## What was the process?
1. Started with sketches on paper/sticky notes of the concept & screens, included logic for the app
2. Translated the sketch content to Figma in black and white
3. Experimented with Proto to better understand the interactions
4. Created a moodboard on Figma for the colors/design concepts
5. Collaborated together on user stories to understand the interactions and features necessary
6. Individually based on the moodboard & user stories came up with our own concepts
7. Merged together our concepts to create the final design
